Researcher Madeleine Orr shatters that illusion in Warming Up: How Climate Change Is Changing Sport. In her debut book, Orr shepherds readers through an at-times overwhelming deluge of all the ways climate change is disrupting sports around the world, providing a compelling case for action from athletes, sports leagues and fans alike. Orr, a sport ecologist at the University of Toronto, draws on her academic expertise to outline how climate change is upending sports, be it wildfires almost destroying a high school football program or rising seas subsuming coastal golf courses. While Orr bolsters her argument with data and interviews with experts, it’s the personal stories that are most powerful. There’s the heartbreaking story of University of Maryland college football player Jordan McNair, who died of heat stroke suffered at practice. Orr, an avid skier, shares her beef with global warming literally melting away winter sports around the world — and the local economies they sustain.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction, Orr says that the order of the chapters is irrelevant. But the chapters do follow a loose organization, and grouping them into sections would have made the overall trajectory of the book easier to follow. The first 11 of the book’s 17 chapters mainly focus on how warming temperatures, rising seas, increasing wildfires and other consequences of climate change are already impacting the industry and will worsen in the future (SN: 12/6/23; SN: 11/9/22; SN: 9/15/21). For instance, outdoor pond hockey, a crucial part of Canada’s culture and the launchpad of many of ice hockey’s greats, is at risk of disappearing altogether as winters become warmer and ice becomes rarer.\r\n\r\nIt’s refreshing to see Orr explicitly talk about how climate change is disproportionately impacting nations that are least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions, a point that can get lost in Western reporting on the topic. High temperatures are threatening Kenyan runners. Rising seas are eroding a famous rugby beach in Fiji. A 2022 flood devastated Pakistan’s sports leagues — along with much of the country.\r\n\r\nBut against the backdrop of climate change’s harrowing reality, Orr keeps hope alive in the last six chapters. The sports world can adapt to climate change to reduce its own culpability and to ensure that imperiled sports survive. She spotlights the past and present activism of athletes who are fighting for sustainability.\r\n\r\nOne heartening example is Innes FitzGerald, a teenage cross-country runner who refused to fly from Britain to Australia for the 2023 World Athletics Championships out of concern for air travel’s carbon emissions (SN: 5/14/20). Before FitzGerald, “no athlete had actually passed up championship opportunities because of a moral quandary with flying,” Orr notes. Like climate activism in so many other sectors of society, it seems changes in sports will be spearheaded by the youth.\r\n\r\nOrr’s writing is authoritative and conversational, and while she sometimes slips into academic jargon, her language is largely accessible even to readers with no scientific background. The book is jam-packed with information and has something for sports fanatics and casual fans alike.

For the first time, astronomers have spotted a middleweight black hole in the nearby universe. The discovery could help solve the riddle of how even heftier black holes form and grow up with their host galaxies.\r\n\r\nThe black hole, which sits about 16,000 light-years from Earth in the center of star cluster Omega Centauri, is at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun, putting it squarely in a rare category of intermediate-mass black holes, researchers report July 10 in Nature. Most of the black holes astronomers have detected fall into one of two categories. They’re either stellar-mass black holes, with masses up to about 100 times that of the sun, or supermassive black holes, which reside in the centers of galaxies and clock in at hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of the sun.\r\n\r\nBlack holes with masses in the middle could help span the gap between the two categories and explain how the supermassive ones got so big. But these black holes are a little like Bigfoot: There have been many claimed sightings, but most turn out not to be real (SN: 2/8/17).\r\n\r\n“There’s this rather wide mass range, between 100 and 100,000 solar masses, where there are only very few detections,” says astronomer Maximilian Häberle of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “It’s interesting to find out whether they are there, and we just don’t see them because they are hard to detect. Or maybe there’s also a reason why they don’t exist at all.”\r\n\r\nOne reason to think midsized black holes should exist is because the supermassive black holes astronomers have spotted in the early universe didn’t have time to grow so big if they were just eating gas and stars like black holes do today (SN: 1/18/21). If those black holes grew from mergers of intermediate-mass seeds, that could solve the puzzle (SN: 6/2/23).\r\n\r\n“It’s like a missing link that is needed to explain the existence of the supermassive black holes,” says Texas-based astronomer and data scientist Eva Noyola, who was not involved in the new work. “If it’s proven that [intermediate-mass black holes] happen in dense stellar clusters, you have a solution there that’s pretty elegant and simple.”\r\n\r\nSo astronomers have been hunting for midsize black holes for decades, and searching Omega Centauri specifically since at least 2008. As the most massive cluster of stars in the Milky Way, it’s a relatively easy spot to search, and it may be the remnant core of another galaxy that merged with the Milky Way about 10 billion years ago (SN: 11/1/18).\r\n\r\n“It’s basically a galactic nucleus frozen in time,” says study coauthor Nadine Neumayer, also of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. Its black hole could be representative of all small galaxies’ black holes 10 billion years ago. “It tells us immediately something about the seed mass for black holes.”\r\n\r\nBut previous studies left it unclear whether Omega Centauri hosted a single medium-size black hole, or a bunch of smaller black holes close together.\r\n\r\nUsing 20 years of Hubble Space Telescope observations, Hӓberle and colleagues tracked the motions of 1.4 million individual stars in the cluster and searched for stars moving faster than expected.\r\n\r\nThe team found seven stars zipping around the innermost regions of the cluster at speeds between 66 and 113 kilometers per second — speeds that should have rocketed the stars out of the cluster altogether. The only way those stars could remain in the cluster is if a single massive object is holding them close, the team concludes.\r\n\r\nThe observations of superfast stars, combined with other observations through the years, should resolve the debate about the black hole in Omega Centauri, says Noyola, who was on the team that first claimed to see the black hole in 2008 and faced skepticism when they reported the result.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until over a decade later that astronomers nabbed undeniable evidence of an intermediate mass black hole. The first solid detection came from the LIGO gravitational wave observatory, which recorded ripples in spacetime shaken off after two smaller black holes merged to form a single black hole with about 142 solar masses (SN: 9/2/20). But that collision occurred about 17 billion light-years from Earth, making it challenging to study.\r\n\r\nOmega Centauri’s black hole has two advantages over that one, from an astronomer’s perspective: It’s in our galactic neighborhood, and astronomers can continue to observe it. Hӓberle and his colleagues are planning to use the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, to get more information on the orbiting stars’ speeds, which will let them put better limits on the black hole’s mass.\r\n\r\nAnother group, led by astrophysicist Oleg Kargaltsev at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., is using JWST to look for light emitted by super-hot gas flowing into the black hole.\r\n\r\n“It will be a completely independent, very different method of proving that there is an intermediate-mass black hole,” Kargaltsev says.", "category": 2, "user": 1, "image": "post_images/071024_lg_intermediate-black-hole_feat.webp"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"published_date": "2024-07-22T05:15:09Z", "title": "After 1177 B.C.", "content": "‘After 1177 B.C.’ describes how societies fared when the Bronze Age ended\r\nThe book reconstructs ancient examples of societal resilience and fragility. A toxic brew of calamities that included drought, earthquakes, famine, disease and invasion undermined civilizations across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East about 3,200 years ago. But that Late Bronze Age collapse was not a one-size-hits-all event. Archaeologist Eric H. Cline sees it as a complicated tragedy and transition, with only some societies vanishing. Others took hard hits but rebounded after a few centuries or muddled through a progressive decline in power. Certain societies adapted to a new world, or even transformed and prospered amid chaos (SN: 7/3/19). In After 1177 B.C., Cline consults ancient inscriptions written on stone, clay, papyrus and more, along with other artifacts and excavated sites, to outline the many ways major Bronze Age societies responded to tumultuous times. Their divergent trajectories during the Iron Age that followed — what researchers mistakenly called a dark age until the 1980s — hold lessons for people today, Cline writes.\r\n\r\nAnyone concerned with avoiding the end of the world as we know it might be especially interested in the societies that flourished in the wake of the Late Bronze Age collapse. Cline regards those success stories as exhibiting what Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a risk analyst, has called antifragility, an ability to get stronger in the face of disorder (SN: 4/4/13).\r\n\r\nFor instance, Central Canaanite people in coastal Middle Eastern cities, now known as Phoenicians, took over major Mediterranean maritime trade routes after the sacking of formerly dominant port cities (SN: 3/16/22). Though trade opportunities diminished, Phoenician mariners still exchanged goods, including a popular purple dye, for silver and other metals from Sicily, Sardinia and Iberia. As their trade ties grew, Phoenicians spread an alphabetic system that formed the basis of written English and many other modern languages.\r\n\r\nCline discusses growing evidence for similar victories on Cyprus. People there established towns and governments in new areas as drought-related soil erosion caused silt to fill formerly busy harbors. Evidence indicates that bronze metalworkers in Cyprus pioneered technical innovations that led to a region-wide iron industry.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristics of resilient societies: multiple contingency plans for extreme weather events and other emergencies, solid defenses against enemy attacks, dependable water resources and a happy working class. But for others, the Late Bronze Age collapse exposed weaknesses ranging from manageable to fatal.\r\n\r\nAssyrians and Babylonians in ancient Mesopotamia weathered the collapse with their social systems intact, Cline concludes. But royal records refer to population declines linked to drought, famine and plague, and it took centuries for these societies to regain their former prominence. That’s a form of resilient survival well short of Phoenicians’ “antifragile” growth during chaos.\r\n\r\nEgyptian civilization “was never the same again,” Cline writes. Egypt’s power and status in international trade declined, as did the standard of living for average folks, he suggests. Mycenaean society on mainland Greece proved especially fragile, vanishing by about 3,200 years ago. But Greeks who survived slowly remade their culture and society, Cline argues. Pottery styles, burial customs and house types were developed from former Mycenaean practices. After a couple hundred years, this cultural reclamation project prompted the rise of Archaic and then Classical Greece, Cline suspects.\r\n\r\nAmid limited records and plenty of academic debate, Cline provides a thought- provoking introduction to current thinking about the Late Bronze Age. He acknowledges that scholars won’t always agree with his views. And though multisyllabic names of ancient kings pile up quickly — an unavoidable consequence of chronicling royal successions in unstable times — a helpful list of rulers and officials appears at the end.\r\n\r\nAs hard as it is to revive the past, predicting the future is even harder. Cline can’t answer whether our civilization, in the face of modern threats, will go the way of the Phoenicians or the Mycenaeans.\r\n\r\nBuy After 1177 B.C. from Bookshop.org.
